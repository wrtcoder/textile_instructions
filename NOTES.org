1. [X] Convert the file names to the proper ones so they can be integrated into the build system
2. [ ] Update the instructions to the 12.10 release
3. [X] Add the RTSM tab
4. [ ] Add a header (In the area on top of the tabs just like the ve_12.09 page
   - No possible due to current restrictions. For now, we added the header to the body of the Release Notes.
5. [X] Create the proper Ubuntu instructions for the Ubuntu build 
6. [X]Push these instructions somewhere (or is this bzr branch is enough) so they can be picked up by the build system
   - Committed the work into Github for now at (https://github.com/situmam/textile_instructions)
