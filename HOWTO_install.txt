h1. Binary Image Installation

Linaro provides two methods for installing Linaro binary builds:

# Using a pre-built image, which you can download
# Assembling your own image using provided components

h2. Pre-Installation Steps

Before any installation begins, it is important that you ensure you Versatile Express board has the latest firmware and boot loader installed. Please check the "Firmware Update" on this page for the latest updates and installation instructions.

h2. Using pre-built image

h3. Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit or newer on your desktop PC (www.ubuntu.com)
* 4GB SD card or larger
* Latest firmware installed onto the Versatile Express. Please see "Firmware Update" tab
* This release pre-built image (vexpress*.img.bz2), which you can downloaded from the above list of artifacts

h3. Installation Steps

* Unzip the downloaded pre-built image
* Insert SD card into your PC and note the assigned @'/dev/sdX'@

bc.
     dmesg
     SDCARD=/dev/sdX   (sdcard found from dmesg above)
     sudo dd bs=64k if=vexpress-jb-gcc47-armlt-tracking-open.img of=$SDCARD

* Boot the board
** Insert the SD card into the board
** Reboot the board
*** “Cmd>" prompt from the Boot Loader
*** Press the red reboot button

*Note:* Windows users may use the "Image Writer for Windows":https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download

h2. Building a custom image using pre-built components.

Sometimes, you may wish to build your own custom image for a Versatile Express. Perhaps you wish to use a more recent snapshot of the "hardware pack":https://wiki.linaro.org/HardwarePacks for Ubuntu or take the latest Android build. Whatever the reason, you will want to use the "Linaro media tools":https://wiki.linaro.org/Linaro-Image-Tools to create a custom image.

Using components to generate the image will yield the same functionality found in the pre-built image of the same release.

h3. Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit or newer on your desktop PC (www.ubuntu.com)
* Download Artifacts from above or use the following command in your terminal

bc.
	wget http://releases.linaro.org/12.10/android/images/vexpress-jb-gcc47-armlt-tracking-open/boot.tar.bz2 http://releases.linaro.org/12.09/android/images/vexpress-jb-gcc47-armlt-tracking-open/system.tar.bz2 http://releases.linaro.org/12.09/android/images/vexpress-jb-gcc47-armlt-tracking-open/userdata.tar.bz2@

* Get "linaro image tools":https://wiki.linaro.org/Linaro-Image-Tools

There are multiple ways you can get the latest Linaro Image Tools:

** Method 1: Install them from the Linaro Image Tools "PPA":https://launchpad.net/~linaro-maintainers/+archive/tools

bc.
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linaro-maintainers/tools@
	sudo apt-get update@
	sudo apt-get install linaro-image-tools@

** Method 2: Building from source.

bc.     wget http://releases.linaro.org/12.09/components/platform/linaro-image-tools/linaro-image-tools-2012.10.1.tar.gz

* Insert SD card and note the assigned @'/dev/sdX'@ or @'/dev/mmcblk0'@

bc.
    dmesg | less

Look for a line that looks like the following at the end of the log
@[288582.790722] sdc: sdc1 sdc2 sdc3 sdc4 <sdc5 sdc6 >@
Or, if your machine uses '/dev/mmcblkX', you may see a line line this:
@[10770.938042]  mmcblk0: p1 p2 p3 p4 < p5 p6 >@

*WARNING:* In the next step, make sure you use /dev/"whatever you see above". You can erase your hard drive with the wrong parameter.

* Create Media

bc.    sudo linaro-android-media-create --mmc /dev/sdX --dev vexpress --system system.tar.bz2 --boot boot.tar.bz2 --userdata userdata.tar.bz2

* Boot the board
** Insert the SD card into the board
** Reboot the board
*** “Cmd>" prompt from the Boot Loader
*** Press the red reboot button
