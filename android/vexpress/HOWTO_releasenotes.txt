h3. Additional information

NOTE: When using the interactive governor with Android, take care to use the following values for governor specific tunables. These values have been selected after careful analysis on this LSK version and result in optimal power-performance on TC2. In future LSK releases, additional system initialisation logic will use these values as defaults.

Interactive settings for the Cortex-A7 cluster:

'above_hispeed_delay': 20000
'go_hispeed_load': 85
'hispeed_freq': 800000
'min_sample_time': 80000
'timer_rate': 20000

Interactive settings for the Cortex-A15 cluster:

'above_hispeed_delay': 20000
'go_hispeed_load': 85
'hispeed_freq': 1000000
'min_sample_time': 80000
'timer_rate': 20000
