p. Linaro releases monthly binary images for the ARM "Versatile Express":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/development-boards/versatile-express/index.php including support for A9, A5, A15 (TC1), TC2 (big.LITTLE) CoreTiles and RTSM.

p. For support matters related to ARM hardware or firmware images downloaded from ARM sites, please contact "ARM support":mailto:support@arm.com

p. This release includes Linaro Android Jelly Bean and Ubuntu Precise Pangolin for Versatile Express and Real-Time System Model ("RTSM":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/software-tools/ds-5/rtsm-simulator.php). The images are able to boot A5 (using U-Boot), A9 (ATAGS), TC1 and TC2 using UEFI. Sources are also made available so you can build your own images.

h2. About the TC2 Evaluation Build

The TC2 CoreTile is the first example of a big.LITTLE system shipped by ARM and serves as a platform for development and test of big.LITTLE software. TC2 contains a tri-core Cortex-A7 cluster and a dual-core Cortex-A15 cluster linked using the CCI–400 coherent interconnect.

The release integrates big.LITTLE development work which can be traced in the big.LITTLE MP working group "git repo":http://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=arm/big.LITTLE/mp.git;a=summary . The integration branch present in 12.10 is big-LITTLE-MP-v9 which includes:

Scheduler modifications to support big.LITTLE
** per-task-load-average-v3-fixed: Paul Turner’s patches enabling the calculation of load on a per-task basis.
** task-placement-v2: Morten Rasmussen’s patches using the per-task load to schedule threads on the big or LITTLE cores as appropriate.
*New:* The patches now take into account multiple domains when making decisions on task migration, with ftrace events added for tracking these migrations.

Hot-plug improvements. The aim of this sequence of improvements is to speed-up and make consistent the time taken to hot-plug cores.
** per-cpu-thread-hotplug-v3-fixed
** cpu-hotplug-get_online_cpus-v1
** rcu-hotplug-v1

Cluster and asymmetric system support
** arm-asymmetric-support-v3-v3.6-rc1 - uses arch_scale_freq_power function to reflect the relative capacity of each core
** arm-multi_pmu_v2 - enables the use of multiple PMU types or sources, for example profiling across both Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters. *New*: Bugfixes and patch restructuring
** arm-multi_pmu_v1 - enables the use of multiple PMU types or sources, for example profiling across both Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters.
** scheduler-misc-v1 - miscellaneous scheduler patches complementing the MP work

Platform Support. In addition to the big.LITTLE MP work the TC2 platform support includes
** CPUidle & CPUfreq support
** hwmon driver allowing, amongst other things, TC2's power, current andenergy measurements to be read through standard sysfs interfaces
** Common clocks implementation
** Regulator driver
** Drivers for previously hard-coded configuration interfaces
** Support self-hosted debugging through idle
** In addition to the CPU PMUs the perf framework supports the CCI-400 PMUs
** Misc fixes in this release
*** safely handle missing CPU frequencies
*** MMC Multi-Block fix
*** amba-clcd Device Treee mods
*** HDLCD fixes

p. This release also adds support for saving the self-hosted debugger setup when a CPU goes through a low power state, where hardware breakpoints are not preserved, and restoring the setup when the CPU is brought
back online.

p. Additionally, support for CPU PMUs present in big.LITTLE systems has been integrated into the kernel, with the framework now also supporting system PMUs. CCI-400 PMUs are the first example
implementation that is using the framework.

p. SCHED_HMP patches for scheduler have now been updated to take into account multiple domains when making decisions on task migration, with ftrace events added for tracking these
migrations.
