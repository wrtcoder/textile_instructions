h1. Linaro Stable Kernel Versatile Express 13.08 Release

p. The Linaro Stable Kernel (LSK) is produced, validated and released by Linaro and is based on the linux stable kernel tree. It is produced to satisfy the requirements of Linaro members. The LSK focuses on quality and stability and is therefore a great basis for member products. It also includes backports of commonly desired features, provided they meet the quality requirements, and also any bug fixes.

p. Linaro releases monthly binary images for the ARM "Versatile Express":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/development-boards/versatile-express/index.php including support for Cortex-A9, Cortex-A5, TC2 (big.LITTLE) CoreTiles and RTSM.

p. For support matters related to ARM hardware or firmware images downloaded from ARM sites, please contact "ARM support":mailto:support@arm.com

p. This release includes Linaro Android Jelly Bean and Ubuntu Raring for both Versatile Express and Real-Time System Model ("RTSM":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/software-tools/ds-5/rtsm-simulator.php). The images are able to boot A5 (using U-Boot), A9 (ATAGS) and TC2 using UEFI. Sources are also made available so you can build your own images (see the 'Building from Source' tab).

h2. About the TC2 Engineering Build

This release is based on the Linux v3.10 kernel.  As a consequence, almost all of the patches in the ARM Landing Team tree have been rebased and refactored to account for the latest upstream content.

The TC2 CoreTile is the first example of a big.LITTLE system shipped by ARM and serves as a platform for development and test of big.LITTLE software. TC2 contains a tri-core Cortex-A7 cluster and a dual-core Cortex-A15 cluster linked using the CCIâ€“400 coherent interconnect.

The release contains the big.LITTLE MP patchset developed by ARM. This patchset is hosted by Linaro and can be found in the linked "git repository":https://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=arm/big.LITTLE/mp.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/big-LITTLE-MP-master-v19. These patches have been developed and rigorously tested in order to enable the ARM Versatile Express V2P-CA15_A7 CoreTile (TC2) to run in full MP mode. This functionality has been optimised for energy and performance bringing it close to the Cortex-A7 (LITTLE) in energy consumption with near Cortex-A15 (big) performance. The patchset also includes optimizations that provide a considerable performance uplift across a wide range of benchmarks. The functionality introduced by this patchset is stable and ready for use on other platforms. Note that at present this LEB release is the reference point for big.LITTLE MP functionality. In future, an LSK (Linaro Stable Kernel) release shall become this reference point and we will clearly advertise this when the change happens.

The patches in the big.LITTLE MP patchset are generic and applicable to big.LITTLE systems with minimal porting effort. To ease porting, the patches are also available as an isolated package located "here":https://wiki.linaro.org/ARM/VersatileExpress?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=big-LITTLE-MP-scheduler-patchset-13.08-lsk.tar.bz2.  This package may be used directly by partners interested in porting the big.LITTLE MP scheduler functionality to their custom platform. Please contact "ARM support":mailto:support-sw@arm.com?subject=Query%20about%20ARM%20big.LITTLE%20MP%20patchset%20package in case of any queries related to this package.

Also provided is optional configurable kernel support for an implementation of ARM's Power State Co-ordination Interface (PSCI). This support is disabled by default. To use PSCI support you will require secure firmware that is currently available to ARM licensees upon request to ARM. Please contact "ARM support": mailto:support-sw@arm.com?subject=Access%20to%20PSCI to get access to the firmware code.

h3. Platform Support. 

In addition to the big.LITTLE MP work the TC2 platform support includes:
** TC2: reset CPUs spuriously woken up on cluster power up
** vexpress: add shim layer for psci backend on TC2
** vexpress: allow native pm ops backends to probe for psci suppport
** psci: add cmdline option to enable use of psci
** psci: add probe function to discover presence of a psci implementation
** psci: convert psci '-EALREADYON' error code to linux '-EAGAIN'
** vexpress: add psci support in TC2 device tree
** psci: add constants to specify affinity levels
** TC2: replace hard coded cluster and cpu values with constants
** TC2: use generic accessors to extract cpu and cluster ids
** CPUidle & CPUfreq support
** hwmon driver allowing, amongst other things, TC2's power, current and energy measurements to be read through standard sysfs interfaces
** Common clocks implementation
** Regulator driver
** Drivers for previously hard-coded configuration interfaces
** Support self-hosted debugging through idle
** In addition to the CPU PMUs the perf framework supports the CCI-400 PMUs
** A patch from Thomas Gliexner which supports a IRQ affinity mask being specified in the command line. This can be used to reduce unnecessary IRQ wakeups on Cortex-A15. For instructions see the irqaffinity entry in Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
** arm-multi_pmu_v2 - enables the use of multiple PMU types or sources, for example profiling across both Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters and getting results for CCI.
