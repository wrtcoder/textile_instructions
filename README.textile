p. Linaro releases monthly binary images for the ARM "Versatile Express":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/development-boards/versatile-express/index.php including support for A9, A5, A15 (TC1), TC2 (big.LITTLE) CoreTiles and RTSM.

p. For support matters related to ARM hardware or firmware images downloaded from ARM sites, please contact "ARM support":mailto:support@arm.com

p. This release includes Linaro Android Jelly Bean and Ubuntu Precise Pangolin for Versatile Express and Real-Time System Model ("RTSM":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/software-tools/ds-5/rtsm-simulator.php). The images are able to boot A5 (using U-Boot), A9 (ATAGS), TC1 and TC2 using UEFI. Sources are also made available so you can build your own images.

h2. About the TC2 Evaluation Build

The TC2 CoreTile is the first example of a big.LITTLE system shipped by ARM and serves as a platform for development and test of big.LITTLE software. TC2 contains a tri-core Cortex-A7 cluster and a dual-core Cortex-A15 cluster linked using the CCI–400 coherent interconnect.

The release integrates big.LITTLE development work which can be traced in the big.LITTLE MP working group "git repo":http://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=arm/big.LITTLE/mp.git;a=summary . *Note:*  This repository now has two main trees. The first, big-LITTLE-MP-exp-v12,  collects experimental patches that have not yet been fully integrated and tested together. The second, and that used for the 12.11 evaluation build is big-LITTLE-MP-master-v12 which includes:

Scheduler modifications to support big.LITTLE
** per-task-load-average-v3-merged: Paul Turner’s patches enabling the calculation of load on a per-task basis.
** task-placement-v2: Morten Rasmussen’s patches using the per-task load to schedule threads on the big or LITTLE cores as appropriate. The patches take into account multiple domains when making decisions on task migration, with ftrace events added for tracking these migrations. *New* Basic global balancing support for HMP - improves performance for cases where multiple 'big' threads are running but allowing the use of LITTLE cores.

** Experimental patches for making load values invariant to frequency settings. This helps reduce the chance of unnecessary up migrations to big cores. 
** An initial version of patches from Vincent Guittot which attempt to pack small (low-load) tasks onto the Cortex-A7 cores and also to improving idle balancing
** A patch from Thomas Gliexner which supports a IRQ affinity mask being specified in the command line. This can be used to reduce unnecessary IRQ wakeups on Cortex-A15. For instructions see the irqaffinity entry in Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
** arm-multi_pmu_v2 - enables the use of multiple PMU types or sources, for example profiling across both Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters and getting results for CCI. 
** scheduler-misc-v1 - miscellaneous scheduler patches complementing the MP work

Platform Support. In addition to the big.LITTLE MP work the TC2 platform support includes:
** CPUidle & CPUfreq support
** hwmon driver allowing, amongst other things, TC2's power, current and energy measurements to be read through standard sysfs interfaces
** Common clocks implementation
** Regulator driver
** Drivers for previously hard-coded configuration interfaces
** Support self-hosted debugging through idle
** In addition to the CPU PMUs the perf framework supports the CCI-400 PMUs
