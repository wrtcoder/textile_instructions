h1. Linaro Versatile Express 12.10 Release Linaro releases monthly

p. Linaro releases monthly binary images for the ARM "Versatile Express":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/development-boards/versatile-express/index.php including support for A9, A5, A15 (TC1), and TC2 (big.LITTLE) CoreTiles.

p. This release includes Linaro Android Jelly Bean for Versatile Express and Real-Time System Model ("RTSM":http://www.arm.com/products/tools/software-tools/ds-5/rtsm-simulator.php)
images.  The image is able to boot A9 (ATAGS), TC1 and TC2 using UEFI. Sources are also made available so you can build your own images.

p. For support matters related to these images, please contact ARM support at support@arm.com

h1. Release Notes

h2. About the TC2 Evaluation Build

The TC2 CoreTile is the first example of a big.LITTLE system shipped by ARM and serves as a platform for development and test of big.LITTLE software. TC2 contains a tri-core Cortex-A7 cluster and a dual-core Cortex-A15 cluster linked using the CCI–400 coherent interconnect.

The release integrates big.LITTLE development work which can be traced in the big.LITTLE MP working group git repo . The integration branch present in 12.10 is big-LITTLE-MP-v9 which includes:

* Scheduler modifications to support big.LITTLE
** per-task-load-average-v3: Paul Turner’s patches enabling the calculation of load on a per-task basis.
** task-placement-v2: Morten Rasmussen’s patches using the per-task load to schedule threads on the big or LITTLE cores as appropriate. New: Refactoring and new generalisation features are featured in this update to the patchset with the aim of facilitating review of the key features by the scheduler community.

* Hot-plug improvements. The aim of this sequence of improvements is to speed-up and make consistent the time taken to hot-plug cores.
** per-cpu-thread-hotplug-v3-fixed
** cpu-hotplug-get_online_cpus-v1
** rcu-hotplug-v1

* Cluster and asymmetric system support
** arm-asymmetric-support-v3-v3.6-rc1 - uses arch_scale_freq_power function to reflect the relative capacity of each core
** arm-multi_pmu_v1 - NEW: enables the use of multiple PMU types or sources, for example profiling across both Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters.
** scheduler-misc-v1 - miscellaneous scheduler patches complementing the MP work

* Platform Support. In addition to the big.LITTLE MP work the TC2 platform support includes
** CPUidle & CPUfreq support
** Misc fixes in this release
*** safely handle missing CPU frequencies
*** MMC Multi-Block fix
*** amba-clcd Device Treee mods
*** HDLCD fixes

p. This release adds support for saving the self-hosted debugger setup when a CPU goes through a low power state, where hardware breakpoints are not preserved, and restoring the setup when the CPU is brought
back onlne.

p. Additionally, support for CPU PMUs present in big.LITTLE systems has been integrated into the kernel, with the framework now also supporting system PMUs. CCI-400 PMUs are the first example
implementation that is using the framework.

p. SCHED_HMP patches for scheduler have now been updated to take into account multiple domains when making decisions on task migration, with ftrace events added for tracking these
migrations.
