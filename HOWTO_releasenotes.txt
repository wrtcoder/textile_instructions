h1. Release Notes

h2. General Features

This release adds support for saving the self-hosted debugger setup
when a CPU goes through a low power state, where hardware breakpoints
are not preserved, and restoring the setup when the CPU is brought
back onlne.

Additionally, support for CPU PMUs present in big.LITTLE systems has
been integrated into the kernel, with the framework now also
supporting system PMUs. CCI-400 PMUs are the first example
implementation that is using the framework.

SCHED_HMP patches for scheduler have now been updated to take into
account multiple domains when making decisions on task
migration, with ftrace events added for tracking these
migrations.  * Feature one * Feature two * Feature three
